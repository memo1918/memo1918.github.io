    Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead.
    The game progresses in steps, where each cell's state is updated based on the states of its neighbors.

    This project is a straightforward implementation of the Game of Life using <u>Python</u> and <u>Pygame</u>.

<h3 class="subhead">Motivation</h3>
<p>
    Well, I was watching this great Conference made by Dylan Beattie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U">The Art of Code</a> and 
    they mentioned the Game of Life. 
    I was blown away when I saw a simulation of the Game of Life running inside itself. It was fascinating to see how complex patterns could emerge from such simple rules.  
    <br><br>
    Since the Game of Life is Turing complete, it can theoretically be used to compute anything. That idea stuck with me, and one night, out of curiosity (and boredom), I decided to code it myself.
