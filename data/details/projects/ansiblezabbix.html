    Zabbix is an open-source monitoring solution used to track system performance and availability. 
    While there are multiple ways to collect data from client machines, one of the most common methods is using the Zabbix agent.
    <br><br>
    This project automates the deployment of Zabbix agents across multiple hosts using an <u>Ansible playbook</u> and simplifies the registration of new machines in the Zabbix server via a <u>Python script</u> that interacts with the <u>Zabbix API</u>.

    <ul>
        <li>Automated installation of the Zabbix agent on multiple machines using an Ansible playbook.</li>
        <li>Automatic registration of new machines in the Zabbix server using a Python script with the Zabbix API.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="subhead">Motivation</h3>
<p>
    In my DevOps role, I frequently use Zabbix for monitoring. Since new machines are added to our infrastructure regularly, manually setting them up in Zabbix was time-consuming.
    <br><br>
    When I joined the team, installing agents and registering them was done manually. 
    To streamline this, I developed a Python script to automate host registration, saving both time and effort.
    <br><br>
    I open-sourced this project on GitHub so others can benefit from it as well.
