    Cloudseeker is a project that aims to make it easier to compare cloud providers and their services. 
    Major cloud providers like GCP, Azure, and AWS each have their own pricing models, making comparisons difficult. 
    Our platform brings them all together in one place, allowing users to quickly identify the most cost-effective cloud services for their needs.
    <br>
    Cloudseeker includes fetching up-to-date data from APIs, easy filtering options and an easy-to-use comparison page where you can see the price differences.

<h3 class="subhead">Core Functions</h3>
<p>
    The web app provides basic <u>filtering</u> and <u>search</u> capabilities also being able to browse through different categories (VMs, Storage etc.). 
    You can add instances to "basket" then to compare the prices between different providers. 
    <br><br>
    Instances are mapped based on their initial configurations, with pricing and specifications fetched from APIs and stored in a database.

<h3 class="subhead">From Development to Victory</h3>
<p> 
    I participated in this project during my Erasmus in Germany. I was mainly responsible for the backend part of the project but I also contributed to the frontend.
    <br><br>
    The mission was given to us by a company called <a href="https://www.stackit.de/en/">STACKIT</a>. Throughout development, we prepared reports and 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schwarzit_schwarzit-hochschuleheilbronn-lernbaeshne-activity-7151471560774631424-uW6i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADJZJCABmjENQ3O154pGmWUJHSUpGbYzfiI">presentations</a> for them. 
    In the end, among 6 groups, our project won <u>first place</u> and a cash prize.

<h3 class="subhead">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p> 
    I had the chance to work in an agile team and learn about the importance of communication and teamwork. 
    It was my first time working on a "large-scale" project with a team of four, and It made me realize that working in a team can be both fun and challengingâ€”especially when things go wrong, and we play the blame game over breaking the main branch! 
    <br>
    <u>SCRUM</u> played a major role in the project, as our grading depended on daily stand-ups and sprint reports.
    <br><br>
    On the technical side, I'm usually the guy who doesn't like to work on the frontend, but using Angular and TypeScript was a good experience for me. I really enjoyed using TypeScript and would like to work with it again.
    This was also my first time with Docker and using Docker not only for deployment but also for development was a good experience.
