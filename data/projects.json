By utilizing AWS features like Multi-AZ deployment, the solution distributes resources across multiple Availability Zones to prevent downtime due to zone-specific issues. <br><br> Terraform, as an infrastructure-as-code tool, enables easy provisioning, adjustment, and replication of the setup. The architecture automatically scales resources based on traffic load, ensuring both performance and cost-efficiency. <br><br> The project aims to deliver a practical solution for creating reliable, always-on cloud environments, minimizing the need for manual intervention and maximizing uptime.",

            "details": "This thesis explores the development of a software prototype for real-time tuning of RGB camera parameters, addressing challenges posed by changing environmental conditions in greenhouse automation. The project focuses on optimizing exposure and white balance to enhance image quality for machine vision applications in plant monitoring. Beginning with a detailed review of digital camera principles, the thesis examines the impact of light variability on image acquisition and evaluates algorithms for dynamic parameter adjustment. <br><br> A gain control algorithm was fully implemented, while a grey-edge white balance algorithm was partially developed. The project involved a deep analysis of vision systems and light, and the developed algorithms were successful, performing on par with built-in solutions of the camera. <br><br> Experiments demonstrated promising results, particularly for gain control, though oscillations and incomplete white balance integration highlight areas for improvement. Recommendations include further tuning in controlled and deployment environments to ensure robust and reliable performance in real-world scenarios. <br><br> <object data=\"../data/Thesis.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"> <p>Your web browser doesn't have a PDF plugin. <a href=\"../data/Thesis.pdf\">click here to download the PDF file.</a></p> </object>" ,

            "details": "The Guitar Transmitter project involved developing a wireless device that allows users to transmit audio signals from an electric guitar to an amplifier, eliminating the need for traditional cables. The system was built using Pi Pico microcontrollers and RF transceivers, combining hardware configuration and software development to optimize the transmission process. <br><br>The project was successful, achieving a working range of up to 10 meters with a latency of less than 5ms, ensuring a seamless experience for musicians. Despite challenges with audio noise and cracking due to the 8-bit resolution, the prototype met its primary goal of functioning as a reliable guitar transmitter. <br><br> Key innovations included the ability to drive multiple amplifiers with a single transmitter and a 16-byte payload per transmission for enhanced performance. Although the prototype isnâ€™t ready for commercialization, it demonstrated the potential for future improvements and paved the way for further exploration into wireless audio transmission.",
